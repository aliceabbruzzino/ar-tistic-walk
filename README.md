The aim of this assignment was to design, develop and
document an interactive prototype. The technologies
used, the objective of the prototype and the approach
taken were completely free. In this case, I approached
Augmented Reality.

The final web application is composed of three different
pages: the home, the map and the view. On the
homepage, the user is approached by a carousel in which
are displayed the instructions of the web application.
Through two buttons, there is the possibility to continue
with the explanation or skip it. In either case, in the end,
the user is redirected to the map page where he can see
his current position and one of the artworks around the
UL campus. Once he has reached the preferred location,
the user can switch between the tabs through the burger
menu and, selecting the view tab, he can scan the barcode
and display the artwork correlated to that position.
